# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html#use-parameters-for-application-configuration

# parameters: This section is used to define various parameters that can be used throughout the configuration.
# images_directory: This is the name of the parameter being defined.
# ‘%kernel.project_dir%/assets/images’: This is the value of the images_directory parameter. It uses a placeholder %kernel.project_dir% which represents the root directory of the Symfony project. The full path would be the root directory followed by /assets/images.

    images_directory: '%kernel.project_dir%/assets/images'

    # default configuration for services in *this* file
